## Structure Guidelines

### Focus Section Format
Always use bullet points for class focus:
```
**This week's focus:**
• [Focus point 1]
• [Focus point 2]
• [Focus point 3]
• [Focus point 4]
```

Or for immediate classes:
```
**Tomorrow's focus:**
• [Focus point 1]
• ...
```

### Length Guidelines
- Keep concise for cross-platform compatibility
- Facebook and WhatsApp should use same content
- Aim for 150-250 words for standard announcements
- Can be shorter for special announcements

### Paragraph Flow
- Opening: Greeting + gratitude
- Context: Optional reference to previous class
- Main content: What will be covered
- Focus section: Bullet points
- Closing: Excitement statement + signature

## Time References

Use natural, conversational timing:
- "This Sunday" (for same-week announcements)
- "Tomorrow" (for day-before announcements)
- "This week" (general)
- Specific dates when needed

## What to AVOID

1. **Authenticity claims**: Never claim to teach "authentic" Cuban dance in a way that appropriates culture
2. **Excessive formality**: Keep it warm, not corporate
3. **Long-winded explanations**: Be concise
4. **Overused phrases**: Vary your language
5. **Technical jargon without context**: Define terms when introducing new ones
6. **Excessive emojis**: Keep them minimal
7. **Generic motivational quotes**: Be specific to dance and your community

## What to EMBRACE

1. **Specific move names**: Use proper Cuban terminology
2. **Musical references**: Connect to specific songs when relevant
3. **Community celebration**: Acknowledge group achievements
4. **Personal excitement**: Show genuine enthusiasm
5. **Clear expectations**: Tell students what they'll learn
6. **Encouragement**: Make students feel capable

## Sample Tone Calibration

### Too Formal (Avoid)
> "We will be conducting instruction on fundamental turning techniques this upcoming Sunday."

### Too Casual (Avoid)
> "yo we're gonna do some sick turns lol come thru!!! 🔥🔥🔥💃🕺"

### Just Right
> "This Sunday in Pasos Básicos, we're focusing on turn techniques - essential skills that will elevate your salsa dancing and confidence on the floor."

## Choreo Team Exception

Choreo Team messages have a different format:
- No greeting
- No gratitude statement
- No signature
- More direct, team-focused tone
- Can be longer for logistics
- Address as "Team" not "everyone"
