## Pasos Básicos Examples

### Example 1: Rumba Integration
```
Hey everyone!

Thank you for trusting me with your dance journey and showing up each week!

What an incredible session last week exploring clave guaguancó!

This Sunday in Pasos Básicos, we're diving into something magical - rumba transitions within salsa. Picture this: you're dancing salsa when the music opens a doorway to rumba. We'll practice reading those musical cues, flowing seamlessly into rumba, then returning to salsa like the conversation never stopped.

What we'll cover:
• Recognizing rumba moments in salsa music
• Proper rumba etiquette and connection
• Smooth transitions in and out

Ready to add this beautiful layer to your dance? See you Sunday on the floor!

Hey everyone!

Thank you for trusting me with your dance journey and showing up each week!

Tomorrow in Pasos Básicos, we're creating a small choreo to "Mente Positiva" - a fun song with lots of hits! We'll work with the section from 2:34 to about 3:17, focusing on moves we already know: mambo, bamboleo, "peek" left turn, and how to adapt them to the music.

This week's focus:
• Choreography to "Mente Positiva"
• Mambo, bamboleo, peek left turn adaptations
• Dancing to musical hits and accents

This Sunday in Pasos Básicos, we're working on finding your own voice and style in musicality to a wonderful song starting at the 1:47 mark. We'll explore compound moves (like mambo with travel) and splitting the basic with moves - where what you do on 123 isn't mirrored on 567.

This week's focus:

## Casino Royale Examples

### Example 9: Student Input Request
```
Hey everyone!

Thank you for trusting me with your dance journey and showing up each week!

Huge thanks for crushing last week's contratiempo session! 🙌

### Example 12: Dancing with Dynamics
```
Hey everyone!

Thank you for trusting me with your dance journey and showing up each week!

This Sunday in Casino Royale, we're working on dynamics. First half: keeping moves really simple and walking around in partner hold (not just caminala). Second half: adding some fun moves.

This week's focus:
• Simple movement and connection
• Walking variations in partner hold
• Dynamic shifts in dancing
• Reading the music for intensity changes

We don't always need to start with our "greatest hits" moves on the dance floor. There are times we want to dance mellow and still enjoy it, then times we want to change the dynamic - usually guided by the music itself. Looking forward to seeing everyone Sunday!

Sabor in every step, flow in every move 💫

### Example 13: Contratiempo Unlocking

As always, our goal is making casino feel smooth, comfortable, and taking the guesswork out of the dance. See you in class tomorrow!

## Choreo Team Examples

### Example 14: Team Update - New Members
```
Team - Exciting News!

I'm thrilled to welcome Dagiadi and Katherine to our choreo group! Dagiadi brings extensive performance and competition experience, while Katherine literally does these types of choreographies professionally. Both attended last Sunday and picked up the beginning sections remarkably quickly, though they won't be able to join us this coming Sunday.

We'll continue building on the routine this Sunday as planned.

As we work toward our 2025 performance goals, please let me know if you have anyone in mind to join the team. Now is the ideal time for recruitment since we're still building the foundation and covering fundamentals that will get us performance-ready next year.

The team is taking shape, and I'm excited about our trajectory.
```

### Example 15: Attendance Reality Check
```
Team Update - Summer Reality Check

I've noticed attendance has dropped recently, which I completely understand given how busy summer months can be. I want to be clear: if anyone no longer wants to participate, especially if performing isn't appealing anymore, that's perfectly okay. You're all still welcome to attend classes without any performance commitment.

For those committed to performing, I'd like us to complete the routine by year-end so we can spend 2025 fine-tuning and performing before CALDAC '26.

Dagiadi and Katherine may join us this Sunday - they're genuinely excited about participating, and I'm thrilled to have them. I'll likely recruit additional members since this is designed as a group performance.

No pressure, just clarity on where we're headed.
```

### Example 17: Power Outage Acknowledgment
```
Hey everyone!

We know some of you may be impacted by the power outages - we have been too. Good news: The Avalon has power and class is ON for tomorrow. I'll update if that changes.

Tomorrow in Pasos Básicos: reviewing two pachanga styles and adding them to our library for a short choreo.

See you in class tomorrow!

Sabor in every step, flow in every move 💫
```

### Example 18: Good News/Bad News Format
